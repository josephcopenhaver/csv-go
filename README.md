## Why does this exist?
I am tired of rewriting this over and over to cover edge cases where other language standard csv implementations have assertions on the format and formatting I can cannot guarantee are valid. I've written variations that cover far less concerns over the years and figured I'll make a superset of one that does everything I need. Feel free to use however you may wish.
